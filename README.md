# Sample Navigation views in Jetpack Compose 
Project forked from: [jmot4](https://github.com/jmot4/Navigate)

## Developed using:
- Android Studio
- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- fun (the most important part!!)

## OVERVIEW
The project showcase navigation between multiple views, in this case: HomeView, DetailView and BarrancoView.
I added a third view (BarrancoView) that still works with the data from previous views and displays it on screen.
